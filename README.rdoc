== Hip-Hop Misogyny Stats

Hip-Hop Misogyny Stats is website that collects stats on the use of misogynistic terms by different hip-hop artists and makes them available via search, a table view and a REST API. You can view the live site at (misogynystats.com)[http://misogynystats.com]. A few notes on how the site works:

* The site was built using Ruby on Rails, specifically, Rails v4.2.1.

* It makes use of Tim Rogers' (Rap Genius gem)[https://github.com/timrogers/rapgenius], in order to perform searches on Rap Genius lyrics. 

* It uses this (Social-Buttons gem)[https://github.com/iffyuva/social-buttons] in order to provide Twitter and Facebook sharing links on each rapper's show page.
